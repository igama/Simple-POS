This project project does not pretend to be a Full Point Of Sale. It's target is limited. It's based on a real need, and I'm developing it as a way to learn Rails.

There will be 2 ways of accessing the app. 
 - Customer URL - Not Started
 - Employee URL - In Progress

Employees : 
 - store_url - This will be the Point Of Sale
 - Add products to cart
 - Checkout, ask client for details and submit order. 
 - Generate PDF from order. This will generate login information for client to access website_url.
 - Order is associated to employee and shop (there can be various shops)
